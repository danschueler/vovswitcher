This is the file needed to run the VoV Switcher application.  It runs on top of a LAMP stack on a Raspberry Pi.  It is used to switch audio sources from multiple studios on an intranet.

The application as coded uses fixed ip addresses.  One for Station Playlist, our automation software, and one for a Broadcast Tools Universal 4.1 MLR Web hardware switch.
